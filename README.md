To determine and rank which U.S. states have the cheapest winter hotels, I utilised web scraping techniques on Booking.com. The search was conducted for hotel prices for the following criteria:

Check-in Date: Wednesday, 11th December 2024
Check-out Date: Thursday, 12th December 2024
Guests: 2 adults, 0 children, 1 room

After scraping the data, it was found that the cheapest hotel listed was the Mountain Aire Inn Sevierville - Pigeon Forge located in Sevierville, Tennessee, with a price of Â£46 for the specified stay.

This scraping process can be repeated for other states to compile a complete ranking of hotel prices across the U.S. during winter, focusing on the cost-effectiveness of accommodations in various regions.
